# Godot2DPlatformerMovement
It is a basic 2d character controller script for Godot 3.5. I did not add coyote time, long jump, double jump etc. Maybe consider later.

Why this is here? 

Because lets assume you want to test quickly some assets or maybe an idea and I don't want to rewrite same code again and again. Quickly copy&paste and here you go.

If you want more advanced character controller you need more than this script obviously.
